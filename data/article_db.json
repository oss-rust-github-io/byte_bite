The shelling forced a nearly full shutdown of Avdiivka, which lies some 90 kilometres southwest of Bakhmut, where Russian troops claim to have control. A top Ukrainian military official, Vitaliy Barabash, said that the Russian onslaught is turning Avdiivka into 'a place from post-apocalyptic movies.' The Ukrainian military claims that Russia could make Avdiivka a 'second Bakhmut,' where fierce fighting described as a 'meat grinder' has turned the city into rubble.
